## Additional Information

1)Read <b>Requirements.txt</b> <br><br>
2)Ensure to install these requirements in virtual environment mostly named as <b>"env"</b>.<br><br>
3)<b>Virtual environment</b> prevents version conflicts from different projects and help us to install only those libraries necessary for our Projects.<br><br>
4)<b>Project.db</b> is sqlite database.<br><br>
5)<b>yield.csv</b> is the datset on which the GenAI model works upon.<br><br>
6)Also do not forget to generate <b>Gemini API</b> key and store it in <b>.env</b> file. (Do not share the API)<br><br>
7)<b>Streamlit</b> is used for frontned design due to easy development.
